LRT FRIEND
---------------------

(work in progress) chrome extension to help you track down the "RT" when people post an "LRT" tweet

Will hopefully eventually work on web twitter and tweetdeck =^.^=

##### TODO
- test on tweetdeck
- fix padding on twitter embed
- make twitter/tweetdeck advance the scroll bar a lil bit if necessary to find the RT
- how in the heck do you get this junk into the chrome store now that chrome extensions are all restricted?
- maybe make it so that the script isn't just one gigantic eventListener? (MAYBE, I GUESS)
- save a "test" version of twitter/tweetdeck so i don't have to keep making test RTs :/
